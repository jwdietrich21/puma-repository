Unit Converter Notes

The Unit Converter is a Pascal unit that provides functions for parsing 
measurements consisting of measurement values and units. It also supports 
conversion of measurements from one unit to another one.

In order to use the Unit Converter in your own enterprises you simply have to 
add the file "unitconverter.pas" to your project. The other files in this 
directory are for unit testing with FPCUnit or DUnit, respectively. They are not 
necessary for normal use, except for the case that you want to improve and test 
the Unit Converter.

The PUMA Unit Converter is compatible with Free Pascal 2.6.0 or newer, Lazarus 
1.0.10 or newer and Delphi 7 or newer.
