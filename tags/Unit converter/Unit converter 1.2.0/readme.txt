Unit Converter Notes

The Unit Converter is a Pascal unit that provides functions for parsing measurements consisting of measurement values and units. It also supports conversion of measurements from one unit to another one.

In order to use the Unit Converter in your own enterprises you simply have to add the file "unitconverter.pas" to your project. The other files in this directory are for unit testing with FPCUnit. They are not necessary for normal use, except for the case that you want to improve and test the Unit Converter.
